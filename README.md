Slim19/21

Recycle the S19/S21 extruded aluminum into a 120V loki rig with this retrofit kit that only requires 2 120mm fans, a CB, APW3++, pivotalpleb.com lokit kit, power cables, and 1kg roll of filament.

Licensing is a capital tool. Do what you want with the files.

If you would like to send me a few sats, they will go into my business treasury here @ ⚡structur3llc@strike.me ⚡ and it is greatly appreciated.
